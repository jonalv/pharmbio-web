## Entering the era of “Big Data”: defining and modeling adverse outcome by omics-driven informatics

*Date:* Wed 30 May, 15.00
*Location:* Seminar room, C4:2, BMC
No registration needed

*ABSTRACT*
The rapidly developing “Big Data era” in toxicology involves generation of large amounts of safety testing data and the need to interpret the results relative steadily increasing amounts of related information in databases. Cell culture models serve for high-throughput screening and omics analysis, allowing libraries of drugs, chemicals and nanomaterials to be effectively assessed and ranked for cytotoxicological properties. Mechanistic analyses of toxicity-related pathways form a key to in-vitro-only safety assessment and the emerging Adverse Outcome Pathways (AOP) concept. Our laboratory generated a “predictive toxicogenomics space (PTGS)” concept that serves to generate toxicity estimates intrinsic to omics-data via broad dose-dependent coverage of cellular toxicity reactions and mechanisms. Validation studies show that PTGS enables application of in vitro data to predict liver injury in experimental animals (long-term repeated-dose toxicity bioassays) and to define dose levels of concern for drug-induced liver injury in humans. The PTGS serves excellently to explore modes of action related to applying AOP in predictive analyses. Overall, the PTGS concept is directly applicable to an evolving in vitro and in silico-based safety testing market, including taking a safe innovation approach to drug development, chemicals safety and functionalization of nano materials.
