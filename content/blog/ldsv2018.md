pharmb.io is this year co-organizing a symposium named ["Linked Data in Sweden"](https://lankadedata.se/LDSV/).  It is a symposium held annually with
the aim to bring people together to share experiences around Linked Data.

This year, the event is hosted by the [SciLifeLab Data Centre](https://www.scilifelab.se/data/),
at the BMC campus of Uppsala University ("Navet building").

[Samuel](https://pharmb.io/people/saml) from the group will present some of the
work done in the group regarding handling on large scale linked / semantic
data.

You can find more information about the event, including a tentative agenda, on
its [webpage](https://lankadedata.se/LDSV/2018/), as well as the
[SciLifeLab event](https://www.scilifelab.se/events/linked-data-in-sweden/).
