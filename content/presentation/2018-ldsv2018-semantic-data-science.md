abstract = "Data in the life sciences are growing at an exponential rate. The semantic web technologies which were initially thought up before the \"Big Data\" era, have not always been optimal for handling really large data sets. Based on our experience, the situation can improve with the right approach, and some promising new developments to better merge the worlds of semantic and big data."
